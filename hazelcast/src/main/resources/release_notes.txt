This document lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for Hazelcast IMDG 4.0.2 release. The numbers in the square brackets refer to the issues in Hazelcast's GitHub repositories.


## Enhancements

* Introduced the `ConfigRecognition` API that determines
if a provided declarative configuration is recognized by the
rules defined in a given implementation. [#17093]
* Introduced WAN throttling mechanism: this allows
the WAN publishers to overload the WAN consumers if transferring the WAN
events takes less time than processing them in the target cluster. This
can be the case with WAN synchronization if the network latency is low
enough. It can be configured using the following properties:
  ** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.invocation.threshold`
  ** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.init`
  ** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.max`
  ** `hazelcast.wan.consumer.ack.delay.backoff.multiplier`

  See https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/blob/4.0.2/hazelcast/src/main/java/com/hazelcast/spi/properties/ClusterProperty.java#L1112 for their explanations. [#17088]
* Removed a constraint which was rejecting all the operations
except the ones marked with `AllowedDuringPassiveState` while a
member is shutting down. With this enhancement, operations are allowed
and this provides additional safety guarantees especially for the members
holding large amounts of data. [#17029]
* Introduced a packet flag to distinguish between the connections of members
having the same Hazelcast version and different versions. [#16993]
* Updated `pom.xml` to have the latest version of the Hazelcast AWS plugin,
which introduced the support for AWS Fargate. [#16990]
* Added the `load()` method to `Config`, `ClientConfig` and
`ClientFailoverConfig` classes. This method loads the configuration
with the known locations. If not found, the default configuration is returned. [#16903]
* Added the missing partition/active partition count descriptor constants
to the metrics. [#16858]

##  Fixes

* Fixed an issue where the split-brain protection events were triggered during the
startup of members, but before they join the cluster. With this fix,
these listeners will not be fired until the minimum cluster size (quorum) is met after the
member startups. [#17090]
* Fixed an issue where the CP client message tasks were deserializing
the responses. [#17054]
* Fixed the broken interoperability between the `CompletableFuture`
methods. [#17048]
* Fixed an issue where the Hazelcast cluster having advanced network
configuration was not sending the proper connection information
to Management Center. [#17003]
* Fixed an issue in the cache service where its pre-join
operation was considering `CacheConfig` as resolved: it
was assuming that key/value types, user customizations and
other cache configurations have been loaded. This was an issue
when the cache is not touched yet. [#16918]
* Fixed an issue where the Hazelcast instances were failing to start
due to a missing flag for the cluster status. [#16852]
* Reverted the change where Hazelcast was not retrying an invocation if it is sent
to a specific member and returns the  `TargetNotMemberException` exception. [#16843]
* Fixed an issue where the class definitions, that are registered explicitly in
the serialization configuration and have the same class ID in different factories,
were not handled properly. [#16833]
